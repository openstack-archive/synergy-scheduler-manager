 SYNERGY SCHEDULER MANAGER
------------------------------

Synergy is as a new extensible general purpose management OpenStack service. 
Its capabilities are implemented by a collection of managers which are specific
and independent pluggable tasks, executed periodically or interactively. The
managers can interact with each other in a loosely coupled way.
The Scheduler Manager provides advanced scheduling (fairshare) capability for OpenStack.
In particular it aims to address the resource utilization issues coming from the 
static allocation model inherent in the Cloud paradigm, by adopting the dynamic 
partitioning strategy implemented by the advanced batch schedulers.
